This is Ali Shahroor Visualisation from the https://github.com/aloosh163/2022-4516CSQR-Group1 

This Dataset was taken from: https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets#machinelearning 

My Visualization can be run by
1.	Considering the program will already be saved as python, all that is required will be when the user runs it from whichever software they are using
2.	I have implemented this program in Jupyter notebook, so if the user wishes to run it from Jupyter they can run the program by clicking a run icon.

To run any code in a Github repository, you will either need to download it or clone it. On the top right of the repository, click the green "clone or download repository" button. In order to clone, you will need to have git installed on your computer. Then, follow the instruction given in https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/clone-a-git-repository/ . Click here to download. Once you have it on your machine, how you run the code will depend on what type of code your project is written in.
